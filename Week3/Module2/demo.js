unctionadd(a,b){returna+b}//Create a method called memoize such that:constmemoizeAdd=memoize(add);//then calling...memoizeAdd(100,100);//returns 200memoizeAdd(100);//returns 100memoizeAdd(100,200)//returns 300memoizeAdd(100,100)//returns 200 without computingGuidelines:1.The memozie function should be written from scratch.2.3rd party libraries such as loaddash or underscore should not have been used.3.The function should carry a name which should denote the functionality of it.4.The function should be able to take n number of arguments.Outcomes:1.Understanding how caching works.2.Why is it important?3.The problem memoization solves.
